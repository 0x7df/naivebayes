1. Introduction
In this article we describe alternative quadrature sets for solving the neutron transport
equation via the Discrete Ordinates (SN) Method. The standard quadrature set for solving
the Linear Boltzmann Equation[1] is the Level Symmetric Quadrature Set[1]. This method
is applicable up to order N=20, because beyond which the associated weights of the
selected directions become negative. This of course is not physically acceptable hence
other methods are needed.
There is growing need for higher order quadrature sets (N>20) when dealing with nonconventional problems such as simulation of a CT-Scanning Device[2] or simulation of a
Time-Of-Flight experiment [3] . Both problems include highly directional sources and
media containing large regions of air.
For this purpose we have developed and tested other types of quadrature sets like Equal
Weight (EW), PN-EW and PN-TN[4]. These quadrature sets are suitable for higher (>20)
SN orders, without any difficulty related to negative weights.
Further, we have developed a new technique called Ordinate Splitting, which can be very
effective for problems with highly peaked directional sources and/or fluxes.
These quadrature techniques have been implemented into the PENTRAN code (Parallel
Environment Neutral-Particle TRANsport)[5] and tested for solutions of the two problems
mentioned earlier.

2. Description of the Equal Weight, PN-EW and PN-T N sets
The Equal Weight quadrature set is generated dividing one octant of the unit sphere in M
directions, with M=N(N+2)/8and assigning an equal weight to each direction wi =1/M.
For the PN-EW and PN-TN sets, two different kind s of orthogonal polynomials are applied
to obtain the discrete directions; these are the Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials [4]. In
the PN-EW quadrature set the levels along the z-axis are selected as the roots of the
Legendre polynomial of order N, corresponding to the N levels of the Level-Symmetric
approach. For the azimuthal angle, however each level is divided equally again following
the Level Symmetric approach. This means that the number of directions per level is
equal to N/2 – i + 1 with i = 1,2.., N/2
For the PN-TN, similar to PN-EW, levels are set equal to the roots of the Legendre
Polynomial, while the azimuthal angles for each level are selected as roots of Chebyshev
polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials have the following expression[4]:
Tl[cos(w)]=cos(lw)

These polynomials satisfy the orthogonality condition and the roots between 0 and Pi can
be easily evaluated as follow[4]:
wi = [(2l – 2i + 1)/2l] *Pi
Where the parameter l in the previous expression is the total number of directions per
level.
The weights of levels for both PN-EW and PN-TN quadrature sets are evaluated by
preserving the even moments of the Gauss-Legendre[4] polynomials, while equal weights
are assigned to the directions in the same level.

3. Ordinate Splitting Technique
The Ordinate Splitting Technique is a method which is suitable to solve problems where
the particle angular flux and/or source are peaked along certain directions of the unit
sphere. This procedure can be considered as a biasing technique acting on discrete
directions.
The idea is to select a direction of flight of the neutron and split it into a certain number
of directions of equal weights, while conserving the original weight.
Currently we divide the solid angle, associated to the direction of interest, into equal size
sectors. Then we place the directions on the corner and on the midpoint of the side of the
sectors, while the original direction is at the center. A proper selection of the sector
surrounding the original direction is performed to avoid overlapping with other
directions. In figure 1 we can observe the applicatio n of ordinate splitting technique to
one direction.

4. Verification and Accuracy of PN-EW and PN-T N quadrature sets
The new sets with Ordinate Splitting capability have been implemented into the
PENTRAN code.
In order to verify the PN-EW and PN-TN quadrature sets and to check their accuracy, we
have set up a simple benchmark, consisting in a homogeneous parallelepiped. An
isotropic source is placed in lower left corner as shown in figure 2. Due to the symmetry
of the proble m the particle current s flowing out in regions A and B (see Figure 2) must
have the same value. Figure 3 shows the relative difference between the particle current

in regions A and B for each quadrature set. For Level Symmetric this value is zero
because it provides perfect symmetry as expected. The PN-TN yields almost perfect
symmetry, while the PN-EW and Equal Weight both show maximum relative differences
of 4% and 10% respectively.

5. Results
We have examined the effectiveness of these quadrature sets for simulating a CTScanning Device[2] and a Time-Of-Flight experiment [3] using PENTRAN. The CT-Scan
is a device utilized for medical computer tomography. The simulation of this devic e via
the transport equation is subjected to two major difficulties: the angular distribution of
the X-ray source and the “ray-effects” generated by transporting the radiation through
large amount of air. In order to overcome these difficulties we have utilized the new
quadrature sets and the ordinate splitting technique.
In figure 4, we compare the results of PENTRAN with a reference MCNP Monte Carlo[6]
solution. For all cases, we split the first direction of the lowest level in 9 or 25 directions,
e.g. PN-TN22-2-55 corresponds to S22 with direction 55 split in 9 directions. All the
quadrature sets that use Ordinate Splitting (designated by OS), yield accurate results
within the statistical uncertainty of MCNP predictions.
The Level Symmetric S20 quadrature set (440 directions) without ordinate splitting
provides poor results. Even using high order quadrature such as PN-TN S28 (840
directions) underpredicts the results by about 21%.
The Time-Of-Flight[3] experiment consists of measuring the transmission of acceleratorgenerated neutrons(E>1MeV) through spherical iron shells. The main difficulties in the
simulation of this system are the large amount of air present and the collimated beam of
neutrons. We have concluded that the new PN-TN set with splitting yields a flux
distribution in good agreement with the Monte Carlo solutions. For further information,
please refer to Ref. 3.

Conclusions
We have developed new quadrature sets including Equal Weight, PN-EW and PN-TN with
a new technique called “Ordinate Splitting”. We have tested these quadrature sets against
the conventional Level Symmetric. For a symmetric test problem, the PN-TN, similar to
the Level Symmetric method, accurately predicts a symmetric set of solutions for flux
and current, while the Equal Weight and PN-EW yield correct solutions with maximum
relative difference of 10% and 4%, respectively.
Further, the new quadrature sets were used to simulate a CT-Scanning Device and a
Time-Of-Flight experiment. Results of these simulations demonstrate that the “Ordinate
Splitting” is very effective for achieving accurate solutions with relatively low order
quadrature sets.
