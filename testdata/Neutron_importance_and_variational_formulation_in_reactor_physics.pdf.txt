Abstract:
The neutron importance is studied as a physical concept for a time-dependent system considering the case where successive detections are made
as well as the final detection. Successive detections make the importance equation inhomogeneous. Based on the physical interpretation of neutron
importance, a new formulation of variational principles are proposed in a manner applicable to time-dependent systems. The proposed variational
functionals are to be understood not as Lagrangian densities as in classical or quantum theory of fields but as total detection data in experiments. As an
application, a method of Green's functions is developed to improve successively a trial flux. The modification factor for the source term in the diffusion
equation is derived in a most elementary way. (Author)
