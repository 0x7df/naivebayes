The generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method (Saad and Schultz, 1986) is an
extension of the minimal residual method (MINRES), which is only applicable to
symmetric systems, to unsymmetric systems. Like MINRES, it generates a sequence
of orthogonal vectors, but in the absence of symmetry this can no longer be done
with short recurrences; instead, all previously computed vectors in the orthogonal
sequence have to be retained. For this reason, "restarted" versions of the method
are used.

In GMRES, this basis is formed explicitly:
The reader may recognize this as a modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization.
Applied to the Krylov sequence
this orthogonalization is called the "Arnoldi
method" (Arnoldi 1951). The inner product coefficients
and
are
stored in an upper Hessenberg matrix.
The GMRES iterates are constructed as

have been chosen to minimize the residual norm

. The GMRES algorithm has the property that this residual norm can be
computed without the iterate having been formed. Thus, the expensive action of
forming the iterate can be postponed until the residual norm is deemed small
enough.
In this scheme, UPDATE

replaces the following computations:

The generalized minimal residual method is designed to solve nonsymmetric linear
systems (Saad and Schultz 1986) The most popular form of GMRES is based on a
modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure and uses restarts to control
storage requirements.
If no restarts are used, GMRES (like any orthogonalizing Krylov subspace method)
will converge in no more than steps (assuming exact arithmetic). Of course this is
of no practical value when is large; moreover, the storage and computational
requirements in the absence of restarts are prohibitive. Indeed, the crucial element
for successful application of GMRES( ) revolves around the decision of when to
restart; that is, the choice of . Unfortunately, there exist examples for which the
method stagnates and convergence takes place only at the th step. For such
systems, any choice of
less than fails to converge.
Saad and Schultz (1986) have proven several useful results. In particular, they
show that if the coefficient matrix
is real and nearly positive definite, then a
"reasonable" value for may be selected. Implications of the choice of
are
discussed below.
A common implementation of GMRES is suggested by Saad and Schultz (1986) and
relies on using modified Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization. Householder
transformations, which are relatively costly but stable, have also been proposed.
The Householder approach results in a three-fold increase in work associated with
inner products and vector updates (not with matrix vector products); however,
convergence may be better, especially for ill-conditioned systems (Walker 1988).
From the point of view of parallelism, Gram -Schmidt orthonormalization may be
preferred, giving up some stability for better parallelization properties (Demmel et
al. 1993). Here we adopt the modified Gram -Schmidt approach.
The major drawback to GMRES is that the amount of work and storage required per
iteration rises linearly with the iteration count. Unless one is fortunate enough to
obtain extremely fast convergence, the cost will rapidly become prohibitive. The
usual way to overcome this limitation is by restarting the iteration. After a chosen
number of iterations , the accumulated data are cleared and the intermediate

results are used as the initial data for the next
iterations. This procedure is
repeated until convergence is achieved. The difficulty is in choosing an appropriate
value for . If
is too small, GMRES( ) may be slow to converge, or fail to
converge entirely. A value of
that is larger than necessary involves excessive
work (and uses more storage). Unfortunately, there are no definite rules governing
the choice of ; choosing when to restart is a matter of experience.
For a discussion of GMRES for vector and shared memory computers see Dongarra
et al. (1991). For more general architectures, see Demmel et al. (1993).
