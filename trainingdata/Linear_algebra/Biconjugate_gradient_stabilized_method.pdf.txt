The biconjugate gradient stabilized method (BCGSTAB) was developed to solve
nonsymmetric linear systems while avoiding the often irregular convergence
patterns of the conjugate gradient squared method (Van der Vorst 1992). Instead
of computing the conjugate gradient squared method sequence
,
BCGSTAB computes
where
is an th degree polynomial
describing a steepest descent update.
BCGSTAB often converges about as fast as the conjugate gradient squared method
(CGS), sometimes faster and sometimes not. CGS can be viewed as a method in
which the biconjugate gradient method (BCG) "contraction" operator is applied
twice. BCGSTAB can be interpreted as the product of BCG and repeated application
of the generalized minimal residual method. At least locally, a residual vector is
minimized, which leads to a considerably smoother convergence behavior. On the
other hand, if the local generalized minimal residual method step stagnates, then
the Krylov subspace is not expanded, and BCGSTAB will break down. This is a
breakdown situation that can occur in addition to the other breakdown possibilities
in the underlying BCG algorithm. This type of breakdown may be avoided by
combining BCG with other methods, i.e., by selecting other values for
in the
algorithm. One such alternative is BCGSTAB2 (Gutknecht 1993). More general
approaches have been suggested by Sleijpen and Fokkema (1993).

Note that BCGSTAB has two stopping tests: if the method has already converged at
the first test on the norm of , the subsequent update would be numerically
questionable. Additionally, stopping on the first test saves a few unnecessary
operations, but this is of minor importance.
BCGSTAB requires two matrix-vector products and four inner products, i.e., two
