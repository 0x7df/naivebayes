There are two types of singular values, one in the context of elliptic integrals, and
the other in linear algebra.

For a square matrix , the square roots of the eigenvalues of
, where
is
the conjugate transpose, are called singular values (Marcus and Minc 1992, p. 69).
The so-called singular value decomposition of a complex matrix
is given by
