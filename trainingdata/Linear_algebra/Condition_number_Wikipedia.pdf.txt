Condition number
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In numerical analysis, the condition number associated with a problem is a measure of that problem's amenability to digital computation, that is, how numerically
well-posed the problem is. A problem with a low condition number is said to be well-conditioned, while a problem with a high condition number is said to be illconditioned.

The condition number of a matrix
For example, the condition number associated with the linear equation Ax = b gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution x will be after approximate solution. Note
that this is before the effects of round -off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating point accuracy of the
computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution, x, will
change with respect to a change in b. Thus, a small condition number will dampen out errors in b to lessen their effect on the solution, wheras a large condition
number will enhance error in b. (As a consequence of this, even a system with a small condition number can have a large error in x if b is not very well known.)
For this problem, the condition number, ?, is defined by
,
in any consistent norm. This number arises so often in numerical linear algebra that it is given a name, the condition number of a matrix :

Of course, this definition depends on the choice of norm.

The condition number in other contexts
Condition numbers for singular-value decompositions , polynomial root finding, eigenvalue and many other problems may be defined.
Generally, if a numerical problem is well-posed, it can be expressed as a function f mapping its data, which is an m-tuple of real numbers x, into its solution, an ntuple of real numbers f(x).
Its condition number is then defined to be the maximum value of the ratio of the relative errors in the solution to the relative error in the data, over the problem
domain:

where e is some reasonably small value in the variation of data for the problem.
If f is also differentiable, this is approximately
