The ratio
of the largest to smallest singular value in the singular value
decomposition of a matrix. The base - logarithm of
is an estimate of how many
base- digits are lost in solving a linear system with that matrix. In other words, it
estimates worst-case loss of precision. A system is said to be singular if the
condition number is infinite, and ill-conditioned if it is too large, where "too large"
means roughly
the precision of matrix entries.

An estimate of the -norm condition number of a matrix can be computed using
MatrixConditionNumber[m, p] in the Mathematica add-on package
LinearAlgebra`MatrixManipulation` (which can be loaded with the command
, 2, or , where omitting the is equivalent to
<<LinearAlgebra`) for
specifying Infinity . A similar approximation for the
condition number is given
by LUDecomposition [mat][[-1]].
