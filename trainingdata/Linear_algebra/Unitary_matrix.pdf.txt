(Minc 1978, p. 25, Vardi 1991).
For real matrices, unitary is the same as orthogonal. In fact, there are some similarities
between orthogonal matrices and unitary matrices. The rows of a unitary matrix are a
unitary basis. That is, each row has length one, and their Hermitian inner product is zero.
Similarly, the columns are also a unitary basis. In fact, given any unitary basis, the matrix
whose rows are that basis is a unitary matrix. It is automatically the case that the columns
are another unitary basis.
The unitary matrices are precisely those matrices which preserve the Hermitian inner
product

Also, the norm of the determinant of
unitary matrices are connected. If

. Unlike the orthogonal matrices, the
is a special unitary matrix.

The product of two unitary matrices is another unitary matrix. The inverse of a unitary
matrix is another unitary matrix, and identity matrices are unitary. Hence the set of unitary
matrices form a group, called the unitary group.
