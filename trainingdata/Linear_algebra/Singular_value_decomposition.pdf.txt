is
a diagonal matrix whose elements are the singular values of the original matrix. If
is a complex matrix, then there always exists such a decomposition with positive
singular values (Golub and Van Loan 1996, pp. 70 and 73).
Singular value decomposition is implemented in Mathematica as
SingularValueDecomposition[m] starting in Mathematica Version 5.0, which
returns a list U, D, V , where U and V are matrices and D is a diagonal matrix
made up of the singular values of .
