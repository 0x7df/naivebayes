Normal matrix
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A complex square matrix A is a normal matrix if
A * A = AA *
where A* is the conjugate transpose of A. (If A is a real matrix, A *=A T and so is normal if A T A = AA T .)

Examples
All unitary, hermitian, and skew-hermitian matrices are normal. (For real matrices, this simplifies as orthogonal, symmetric, and skew-symmetric matrices are
normal.) If A is unitary A* A = AA * = I. If A is hermitian, then A * = A and so AA * = AA = A *A.
It is not the case that all normal matrices are either unitary or (skew-)hermitian; for example,

is normal since

but the matrix is not unitary or hermitian.

It is useful to think of normal matrices in analogy to complex numbers, invertible normal matrices in analogy to non-zero complex numbers, the conjugate transpose
in analogy to the complex conjugate, unitary matrices in analogy to complex numbers of absolute value 1, hermitian matrices in analogy to real numbers and
hermitian positive definite matrices in analogy to positive real numbers.
The concept of normality is mainly important because normal matrices are precisely the ones to which the spectral theorem applies; in other words, normal matrices
are precisely those matrices that can be represented by a diagonal matrix with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal basis of C n. Phrased differently: a matrix is
normal if and only if its eigenspaces span Cn and are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product of C n.
In general, the sum or product of two normal matrices need not be normal. However, if A and B are normal with AB = BA , then both AB and A + B are also normal and
furthermore we can simultaneously diagonalize A and B in the following sense: there exists a unitary matrix U such UAU * and UBU* are both diagonal matrices. In
this case, the columns of U * are eigenvectors of both A and B and form an orthonormal basis of C n.
If A is both a triangular matrix and a normal matrix, then A is diagonal. This can be seen by looking at the diagonal entries of A *A and AA *, where A is a normal,
triangular matrix.
If A is an invertible normal matrix, then there exists a unitary matrix U and a hermitian positive definite matrix R such that A = RU = UR . The matrices R and U are
uniquely determined by A. This statement can be seen as an analog (and generalization) of the polar representation of non -zero complex numbers.
The concept of normal matrices can be generalized to normal operators on Hilbert spaces and to normal elements in C-star algebras.
