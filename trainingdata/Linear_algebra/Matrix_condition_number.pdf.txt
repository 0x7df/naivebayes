The condition number is a measure of stability or sensitivity of a matrix (or the linear system it represents) to
numerical operations. In other words, we may not be able to trust the results of computations on an ill-conditioned
matrix.
Matrices with condition numbers near 1 are said to be well-conditioned . Matrices with condition numbers much
greater than one (such as around
for a
Hilbert matrix) are said to be ill-conditioned .
If
