4.1 Classical Formulas for Equally Spaced
Abscissas
Where would any book on numerical analysis be without Mr. Simpson and his
“rule”? The classical formulas for integrating a function whose value is known at
equally spaced steps have a certain elegance about them, and they are redolent with
historical association. Through them, the modern numerical analyst communes with
the spirits of his or her predecessors back across the centuries, as far as the time
of Newton, if not farther. Alas, times do change; with the exception of two of the
most modest formulas (“extended trapezoidal rule,” equation 4.1.11, and “extended

of various orders, with higher order sometimes, but not always, giving higher
accuracy. “Romberg integration,” which is discussed in §4.3, is a general formalism
for making use of integration methods of a variety of different orders, and we
recommend it highly.
Apart from the methods of this chapter and of Chapter 16, there are yet
other methods for obtaining integrals. One important class is based on function
approximation. We discuss explicitly the integration of functions by Chebyshev
approximation (“Clenshaw-Curtis” quadrature) in §5.9. Although not explicitly
discussed here, you ought to be able to figure out how to do cubic spline quadrature
using the output of the routine spline in §3.3. (Hint: Integrate equation 3.3.3
over x analytically. See [1].)
Some integrals related to Fourier transforms can be calculated using the fast
Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. This is discussed in §13.9.
Multidimensional integrals are another whole multidimensional bag of worms.
Section 4.6 is an introductory discussion in this chapter; the important technique of
Monte-Carlo integration is treated in Chapter 7.

midpoint rule,” equation 4.1.19, see §4.2), the classical formulas are almost entirely
useless. They are museum pieces, but beautiful ones.
Some notation: We have a sequence of abscissas, denoted x 0 , x1 , . . . , xN ,
xN +1 which are spaced apart by a constant step h,
xi = x0 + ih

i = 0, 1, . . . , N + 1

(4.1.1)

A function f (x) has known values at the x i ’s,
f (xi ) ≡ fi

(4.1.2)

We want to integrate the function f (x) between a lower limit a and an upper limit
b, where a and b are each equal to one or the other of the x i ’s. An integration
formula that uses the value of the function at the endpoints, f (a) or f (b), is called
a closed formula. Occasionally, we want to integrate a function whose value at one
or both endpoints is difficult to compute (e.g., the computation of f goes to a limit
of zero over zero there, or worse yet has an integrable singularity there). In this
case we want an open formula, which estimates the integral using only x i ’s strictly
between a and b (see Figure 4.1.1).
The basic building blocks of the classical formulas are rules for integrating a
function over a small number of intervals. As that number increases, we can find
rules that are exact for polynomials of increasingly high order. (Keep in mind that
higher order does not always imply higher accuracy in real cases.) A sequence of
such closed formulas is now given.

of size 2h, so the coefficients add up to 2.

of the function’s second derivative somewhere in the interval of integration. The
coefficient is knowable, and it can be found in all the standard references on this
subject. The point at which the second derivative is to be evaluated is, however,
unknowable. If we knew it, we could evaluate the function there and have a higherorder method! Since the product of a knowable and an unknowable is unknowable,
we will streamline our formulas and write only O( ), instead of the coefficient.
Equation (4.1.3) is a two-point formula (x 1 and x2 ). It is exact for polynomials
up to and including degree 1, i.e., f (x) = x. One anticipates that there is a
three-point formula exact up to polynomials of degree 2. This is true; moreover, by a
cancellation of coefficients due to left-right symmetry of the formula, the three-point
formula is exact for polynomials up to and including degree 3, i.e., f (x) = x 3 :

Perhaps a word here would be in order about how formulas like the above can
be derived. There are elegant ways, but the most straightforward is to write down the
basic form of the formula, replacing the numerical coefficients with unknowns, say
p, q, r, s. Without loss of generality take x 0 = 0 and x1 = 1, so h = 1. Substitute in
turn for f (x) (and for f 1 , f2 , f3 , f4 ) the functions f (x) = 1, f (x) = x, f (x) = x 2 ,
and f (x) = x3 . Doing the integral in each case reduces the left-hand side to a
number, and the right-hand side to a linear equation for the unknowns p, q, r, s.
Solving the four equations produced in this way gives the coefficients.

Extended Formulas (Closed)
If we use equation (4.1.3) N − 1 times, to do the integration in the intervals
(x1 , x2 ), (x2 , x3 ), . . . , (xN −1 , xN ), and then add the results, we obtain an “extended”
or “composite” formula for the integral from x 1 to xN .

Here we have written the error estimate in terms of the interval b − a and the number
of points N instead of in terms of h. This is clearer, since one is usually holding
a and b fixed and wanting to know (e.g.) how much the error will be decreased

Notice that the integral from a = x 0 to b = x5 is estimated, using only the interior
points x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 . In our opinion, formulas of this type are not useful for the
reasons that (i) they cannot usefully be strung together to get “extended” rules, as we
are about to do with the closed formulas, and (ii) for all other possible uses they are
dominated by the Gaussian integration formulas which we will introduce in §4.5.
Instead of the Newton-Cotes open formulas, let us set out the formulas for
estimating the integral in the single interval from x 0 to x1 , using values of the
function f at x1 , x2 , . . . . These will be useful building blocks for the “extended”
open formulas.

Notice that the 2/3, 4/3 alternation continues throughout the interior of the evaluation. Many people believe that the wobbling alternation somehow contains deep
information about the integral of their function that is not apparent to mortal eyes.

This equation is constructed by fitting cubic polynomials through successive groups
of four points; we defer details to §18.3, where a similar technique is used in the
solution of integral equations. We can, however, tell you where equation (4.1.12)
came from. It is Simpson’s extended rule, averaged with a modified version of
itself in which the first and last step are done with the trapezoidal rule (4.1.3). The
trapezoidal step is two orders lower than Simpson’s rule; however, its contribution to
the integral goes down as an additional power of N (since it is used only twice, not
N times). This makes the resulting formula of degree one less than Simpson.

by taking twice as many steps (in this case, it is by a factor of 4). In subsequent
equations we will show only the scaling of the error term with the number of steps.
For reasons that will not become clear until §4.2, equation (4.1.11) is in fact
the most important equation in this section, the basis for most practical quadrature
schemes.

We can construct open and semi-open extended formulas by adding the closed
formulas (4.1.11)–(4.1.14), evaluated for the second and subsequent steps, to the
extrapolative open formulas for the first step, (4.1.7)–(4.1.10). As discussed
immediately above, it is consistent to use an end step that is of one order lower
than the (repeated) interior step. The resulting formulas for an interval open at
both ends are as follows:

evaluate the integrand only at those new points necessary to refine the grid. The bottom line shows the
totality of function evaluations after the fourth call. The routine qsimp, by weighting the intermediate
results, transforms the trapezoid rule into Simpson’s rule with essentially no additional overhead.

There are also formulas of higher order for this situation, but we will refrain from
giving them.
The semi-open formulas are just the obvious combinations of equations (4.1.11)–
(4.1.14) with (4.1.15)–(4.1.18), respectively. At the closed end of the integration,
use the weights from the former equations; at the open end use the weights from
the latter equations. One example should give the idea, the formula with error term
decreasing as 1/N 3 which is closed on the right and open on the left:

4.2 Elementary Algorithms
Our starting point is equation (4.1.11), the extended trapezoidal rule. There are
two facts about the trapezoidal rule which make it the starting point for a variety of
algorithms. One fact is rather obvious, while the second is rather “deep.”
The obvious fact is that, for a fixed function f (x) to be integrated between fixed
limits a and b, one can double the number of intervals in the extended trapezoidal
rule without losing the benefit of previous work. The coarsest implementation of
the trapezoidal rule is to average the function at its endpoints a and b. The first
stage of refinement is to add to this average the value of the function at the halfway
point. The second stage of refinement is to add the values at the 1/4 and 3/4 points.
And so on (see Figure 4.2.1).
Without further ado we can write a routine with this kind of logic to it:
