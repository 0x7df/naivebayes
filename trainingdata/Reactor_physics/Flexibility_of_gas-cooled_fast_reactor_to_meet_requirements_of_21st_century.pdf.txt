Abstract – A new generation of reactor designs are being developed that are intended to meet the
requirements of the 21st century. In the short term the most important requirements are increased
competitiveness and efficiency, low construction and operating costs, inherent safety characteristics and low
proliferation risk. In the longer term there is a need to establish sustainability of fuel and the need to
minimise stocks of separated plutonium and minor actinide waste. The concept of the gas cooled fast reactor
has recently seen renewed interest owing to its flexibility for plutonium and minor actinide management and
its favourable safety characteristics compared to liquid metal cooled fast reactors. This paper presents the
neutronics performance and safety characteristics for a conventional mixed oxide fuelled gas cooled fast
reactor with a carbon dioxide coolant. The significant flexibility of this concept for plutonium management is
demonstrated by the evaluation of a wide range of possible future scenarios. These include a core
configuration capable of high rates of plutonium consumption, a configuration with a negligible breeding
gain aimed at sustainability, and a core design that has been optimised for plutonium breeding. Evidence is
also provided to demonstrate the potential of this gas cooled fast reactor concept for minor actinide
transmutation. One way in which this can be achieved is homogeneous recycling by the addition of small
amounts of minor actinides in the mixed oxide fuelled pins. This is compared with the alternative option of
heterogeneous minor actinide recycling in which minor actinides are loaded in special target sub-assemblies
located in either in-core or ex-core locations. Thus, this study demonstrates the significant flexibility of gas
cooled fast reactor designs toward fuel utilisation and fuel cycle management.

I. INTRODUCTION

These advantages, combined with the extensive
UK experience gained in the successful design and
operation of the carbon dioxide cooled Advanced Gas
Reactors, has led to the investigation of carbon dioxide
cooled fast reactor concepts based on Advanced Gas
Reactor technology but incorporating core design
parameters from the European Fast Reactor1 . A number of
gas cooled fast reactor cores have been considered
including a conventional plutonium burning design, a
configuration with a negligible breeding gain aimed at
sustainability, and a core design that has been optimised
for plutonium breeding. The potential of a gas cooled fast
reactor concept for minor actinide transmutation has also
been investigated2 . There are two main options for
transmutation in a mixed oxide fuelled fast reactor core.
One possibility is to smear a small amount of minor
actinides homogeneously in the mixed oxide fuelled pins.
This is compared with the alternative option of
heterogeneous recycling in which minor actinides are

In recent years there has been increased interest
in gas cooled fast reactor systems for the management of
plutonium and minor actinide stockpiles. Gas cooled fast
reactors offer a number of advantages over liquid metal
fuelled core designs. There are significant safety,
economic and technical benefits to be gained from using a
benign, readily available gaseous coolant which is
compatible with both air and water, compared to sodium
which reacts vigorously with water and requires specialist
handling and disposal. The negligible coolant void
coefficient in gas cooled cores, compared to sodium
cooled systems, allows the loading of a far greater
quantity of degraded plutonium and minor actinide fuels.
An additional feature of a gaseous coolant, in terms of
minor actinide incineration, is the hard neutron spectrum
that exists in gas cooled cores. Gas cooled fast reactors
therefore offer considerable flexibility in core design.

loaded in special target sub-assemblies located in either
in-core or ex-core locations.
This paper reviews the main gas cooled fast
reactor concepts and core designs that have been
considered during the course of this work, concentrating
on the core physics and safety aspects particularly in
terms of plutonium and minor actinide management. The
performance and safety characteristics of each core
concept are presented, compared and discussed. These
studies have confirmed the significant flexibility of gas
cooled fast reactor designs toward future fuel and fuel
cycle utilisation.

common to all of the core configurations considered
during the course of this work.
II.A. Plutonium Burning
In order to determine the scope for plutonium
management the feasibility of a gas cooled fast reactor
core design for high levels of plutonium burning has been
investigated. This option is based on a mixed oxide fuel
with a high plutonium content of degraded isotopic
quality. The feed fuel is the result of uranium oxide output
that has been twice recycled in a mixed oxide PWR. The
plutonium content is constrained to be no more than 45%
by mass to remain within current reprocessing experience
using the PUREX method. The use of a high plutonium
content fuel can only be achieved by a significant
reduction of the fuel inventory for a given core volume.
This has been achieved by the introduction of dilution in
the form of empty pin positions within the fuelled subassemblies. The main core parameters for the plutonium
burning option are shown in Table 1.

II. CORE DESIGN
The basis of the present work is the
demonstration of a feasible design for a gas cooled fast
reactor as a generator of electricity having a similar power
output to that of a conventional commercially sized
sodium cooled fast reactor. Carbon dioxide is less
effective than sodium as a heat transfer medium and so a
larger pin spacing is required to satisfy the same design
limiting criteria, which in turn provides for a reduced fuel
rating. The gas cooled fast reactor design concept is based
on the Hinkley Point B and Heysham 2 / Torness
Advanced Gas Reactors which utilise a single cavity prestressed concrete pressure vessel to house the core
structure, steam generators and gas circulators. The
proposed boiler design, and the limitations imposed by
existing fast reactor fuel technology, have resulted in a
core inlet and mixed mean core outlet temperature of 252
°C and 525 °C respectively with a coolant inlet pressure
of 42 bar.

In common with comparable sodium cooled core
designs, the gas cooled core has a thermal output of 3600
MWth with a load factor of 80%. The reactor is assumed
to have a net thermal efficiency of 40% which therefore
provides an electrical output of 1400 MWe. Conventional
mixed oxide fuel pins with metal cladding are included in
the core. The thermal hydraulic performance of this core
has been assessed to ensure satisfactory cooling of the
fuel pins. The gas cooled core design involves little
extrapolation beyond present day technology and exhibits
adequate thermal hydraulic performance.

II.B. Plutonium Sustainability
The feasibility of a gas cooled fast reactor for
fuel sustainability has also been investigated. To sustain
the nuclear fuel cycle, and maintain fuel stocks at existing
levels, it is intended that this option should neither
consume, nor produce, significant amounts of plutonium,
and that therefore the core breeding gain should be close
to zero. This option is based on a mixed oxide fuel with a
lower plutonium content and cleaner isotopic quality in
comparison with the plutonium burning option. The feed
fuel is the result of a single recycle of uranium oxide fuel
in a PWR.

As the core height is not constrained by
limitations imposed by the coolant void coefficient, as is
the case for a sodium cooled fast reactor, a core height of
1.5 m has been chosen. The steel reflector material
adjacent to the core fuel, and the outer shielding subassemblies, are as currently assumed in comparable
sodium cooled core designs. The control and secondary
shut off rods are the same as those of equivalent sodium
cooled core designs and comprise 24 primary control rods
and 9 secondary shut off rods. These design features are

It can be noted that this core design contains 60 diluent
sub-assemblies located in inner core positions to balance
the peak ratings in the inner and outer core zones. The
main core parameters for the sustainability option are
shown in Table II.

III. NEUTRONICS METHODS
All of the gas cooled core configurations have
been modelled neutronically using the European fast
reactor neutronics code scheme ERANOS Version 1.2
along with the ERALIB1 nuclear cross section data
library 3 . Broad group resonance self shielded cross
sections have been produced for each core material using
the ECCO cell code. A fine group slowing down
treatment is combined with the sub group method within
each fine group to provide an accurate description of the
reaction thresholds and resonances for each type of
critical and sub-critical sub-assembly.

II.C. Plutonium Breeding
To demonstrate the capability of the gas cooled
fast reactor to satisfy the wide range of fuel cycle
scenarios that may occur in the 21st century a gas cooled
fast reactor core design for plutonium breeding has been
investigated. The basic details of the core are similar to
those of the sustainability option. As part of this breeder
core design axial breeder regions of 35 cm and 25 cm
thickness were included below and above the core
respectively. Furthermore, two rows of radial breeder subassemblies were included around the outer edge of the
core.

For conventional applications, such as the
sodium cooled fast reactor, the cross sections are then
condensed and homogenised in the required broad group
scheme to provide effective cross sections that correctly
treat the spatial heterogeneity of the sub-assembly
structure. However, for situations involving low density
regions and strongly anisotropic neutron streaming, such
as the gas cooled fast reactor, these conventional
formulations are insufficient. Hence additional methods
have been used to treat these specific characteristics
correctly.

The breeder sub-assembly dimensions were
identical to the fuel and the dimensions and the number of
fertile pins per breeder sub-assembly was the same as for
the fuel sub-assemblies. However, no central hole is
present in the radial breeder pins. A typical uranium oxide
breeder fuel was assumed for the breeder pins, with
depleted uranium containing 0.25% by mass of U235 . The
main core parameters for the breeder option are shown in
Table III.

3

The strong anisotropy of the streaming is taken
into account by the use of directional collision
probabilities. For low density regions, consideration of the
equivalence between the limiting behaviour of the
diffusion coefficient as the buckling and the cross section
tend to zero has resulted in an alternative derivation of
equivalent buckling dependent cross sections. In this way
homogenised cross sections have been produced for each
material in the gas cooled fast reactor core in 33 neutron
energy groups.

IV. PLUTONIUM MANAGEMENT
In order to assess the capability of the gas cooled
fast reactor for plutonium management three core designs
intended for plutonium consumption, plutonium
sustainability, and plutonium breeding have been
established. For each core design performance and safety
parameters have been calculated at the start and end of
each equilibrium cycle. A summary of the main core
performance and safety parameters, averaged over all
equilibrium cycles, is given in Table IV.

Whole core flux and depletion calculations have
then been performed in 3-dimensional diffusion theory for
each core configuration studied. The control rods have
been modelled with a reduced B10 content to allow for the
transport, heterogeneity and mesh effects that are not
included in the simplified homogeneous control rod
representation employed during these studies.

The results obtained for all three options of this
gas cooled fast reactor core design illustrate the viability
of the concept and show no major difficulties with respect
to core performance or safety. The peak pin burnup has
been determined from the percentage change in heavy
atom concentrations over the residence time of the fuel
within the core and is close to the target value of 20%
heavy atoms in all cases. The peak linear ratings, delayed
neutron fraction and prompt neutron lifetime are
consistent with equivalent values obtained for the
European Fast Reactor.

Consistent flux, isotopic compositions and
macroscopic cross section data corresponding to each
equilibrium core burnup state have been produced using
detailed modelling of the individual fuel batches. The fuel
cycle lengths have been determined by the criterion of
attaining a peak clad damage over the lifetime of the fuel
within the core close to 180 dpa NRT Fe. The inner and
outer core feed fuel enrichments for each core
configuration have been chosen to give balanced inner
and outer core peak ratings and a calculated end of cycle
reactivity close to unity with all control rods withdrawn.
The control rod insertions at start of cycle and middle of
cycle are then adjusted to obtain core reactivity values
close to unity. The core performance and safety
parameters have then been calculated for the start of
cycle, middle of cycle and end of cycle conditions.

The distribution and characteristics of the control
rods, extrapolated from those of the European Fast
Reactor, appear adequate as the necessary shutdown
margins have been satisfied. The Doppler constant,
strongly dependent on the core uranium content, is
reasonable, even for the design optimised for plutonium
consumption where the contribution from U238 capture is
at its lowest.

As expected, the coolant void reactivity
coefficient for the gas cooled fast reactor, at
approximately +250 pcm, is very much smaller than that
associated with sodium cooled fast reactor cores where
the void reactivity worth can approach +2000 pcm. This
confirms the significant safety advantage of the gas
cooled core compared to liquid metal cooled cores. A
fault condition of particular concern in a gas cooled fast
reactor is that of water ingress into the core due to leaks in
the steam generators. It can be seen the effect is large and
negative for this gas cooled fast reactor core design.

Options for the introduction of minor actinides in
a fast reactor core include their introduction
homogeneously as a small percentage of the fuel or
heterogeneously in special target sub-assemblies located
in and around the core. Both these options have been
considered.
V.A. Equilibrium Minor Actinide Transmutation
The study discussed in this section of the paper is
based on the plutonium consumption gas cooled fast
reactor design. The core design has been optimised to
investigate the possibility of burning both plutonium and
minor actinides in proportions such that the minor
actinides from a partitioned waste stream of a uranium
oxide and mixed oxide fuelled reactor fleet are consumed,
along with those produced within the gas cooled core
itself. This is the notion of equilibrium in the consumption
of plutonium and the minor actinides.

These results demonstrate the significant
flexibility with respect to plutonium management that is
afforded by this gas cooled fast reactor core design. It is
possible to change from high rates of plutonium
consumption, in excess of 50 kg/TWhe, to moderate
plutonium breeding, or to sustain existing plutonium
stocks, with only small modifications to the basic reactor
design. Furthermore, this degree of flexibility is
achievable within the constraints imposed by existing fast
reactor fuel and design technology. Thus, it is shown that
the gas cooled fast reactor is capable of satisfying the
wide range of fuel cycle scenarios that may occur in the
near and longer term future.

For homogeneous minor actinide recycling both
neptunium and americium are dispersed homogeneously
in the mixed oxide fuel. In the case of heterogeneous
minor actinide recycling neptunium is mixed
homogeneously in the core fuel but americium is
introduced into target sub-assemblies located in the first
row of radial reflector sub-assemblies around the core.
The target sub-assembly design is based on that of the
fuel sub-assemblies with each target containing 169 pins.
All of the pins in the target sub-assemblies contain
americium dispersed in a matrix of inert material
(MgAl2 O4 – spinel) which extends over the fissile height
of the core. The neptunium and americium content has
been adjusted in each case to achieve an equilibrium
consumption relative to plutonium. It is assumed that
curium has been partitioned and stored. The main core
parameters for the plutonium burner core optimised for
minor actinide recycling are shown in Table V.

V. MINOR ACTINIDE TRANSMUTATION
To reduce the minor actinide content in long
lived waste it is necessary to fission the minor actinide
isotopes rather than to transmute them to higher actinides
by neutron capture. Transmutation by fission of the long
lived minor actinide isotopes requires a hard neutron
spectrum. A gas cooled fast reactor provides a suitable
environment for transmutation.

For each option of minor actinide recycling, core
performance and safety parameters have been determined
at the start and end of each equilibrium cycle. A summary
of the main core performance and safety parameters,
averaged over all equilibrium cycles, is given in Table VI.
Equivalent results for the reference plutonium
consumption core design are also provided for
comparison purposes.

reduced magnitude of the Doppler constant is acceptable.
The reactivity loss over a cycle is also considerably
reduced when compared to the reference plutonium
consumption core design. Again, this is due to the
inclusion of neptunium in the core fuel which leads to the
production of additional plutonium. The characteristics of
the control rods are adequate and the shutdown margins
have been satisfied in all cases.

All cases exhibit acceptable behaviour with
regard to core performance and safety. The peak fuel
burnups in the cores are close to the design value of 20%
heavy atoms. The peak burnup in the heterogeneous
targets is about half of that achieved in the core fuel due
to the reduced fluxes at the core periphery. Similarly, the
peak damage in the targets is only half that attained in the
core fuel. This indicates that a target sub-assembly
residence time one and a half times that of the core fuel
may be possible if the same clad damage limits are
applied.

In the reference plutonium consumption core
design 52.4 kg/TWhe of plutonium is consumed and 4.7
kg/TWhe of minor actinides is produced. In both cases of
minor actinide recycling the plutonium consumption is
reduced to 46 kg/TWhe due to additional plutonium
production from neptunium in the core fuel. However,
there is now a significant consumption of minor actinides,
nearly 9 kg/TWhe for both homogeneous and
heterogeneous minor actinide recycling options. The
consumption rates are such that an equilibrium
consumption of americium and neptunium relative to the
partitioned waste stream has been achieved. Thus, it is
shown that the recycling of minor actinides can be
feasibly undertaken in a gas cooled fast reactor within the
constraints imposed by conventional technology.

There is a significant reduction in the Doppler
constant for the minor actinide recycling core options due
to the inclusion of neptunium in the core fuel. As the
coolant void coefficient remains a negligible effect the

V.B.. Optimised Minor Actinide Transmutation
An evaluation of minor actinide transmutation
has also been performed on the plutonium sustainibility
gas cooled fast reactor core design. To fully investigate
the scope for homogeneous minor actinide recycling a
mixed americium and curium oxide fuel has been added
to the mixed oxide core fuel, with a loading of 3%, 7%
and 10% by volume of minor actinides. As the core
reactivity is modified due to the differing capture rates of
the minor actinide isotopes the plutonium enrichment has
been adjusted to maintain the same value for the core
reactivity at the end of cycle.

The heavy atom burnup in the targets is limited
by their residence time, which is in turn restricted by the
peak clad damage. A multi-recycling of the targets is
therefore required to reduce to a minimum the mass of
minor actinides entering the waste stream. To completely
remove the requirement for multi-recycling it is necessary
to achieve a very high level of mass destruction within the
target in a single irradiation, corresponding to a heavy
atom burnup approaching 90% heavy atoms.

6

The introduction of a moderating material within
the target, and the consequent softening of the neutron
spectrum, reduces the peak clad damage while also
increasing the minor actinide transmutation rate. Thus, a
moderator material can be effectively used to extend the
target residence time and hence increase the heavy atom
burnup while retaining the existing limit on the fuel clad
exposure.

A study of heterogeneous minor actinide
recycling has been performed for the plutonium
sustainability core design using moderated targets located
in both in-core and ex-core locations. The target design
contains 312 target pins and 157 pins containing a
zirconium hydride moderator. The target pins have an
external radius of 3 mm with a clad thickness of 0.5 mm.
The target material is a mixed americium and curium
oxide located in an inert spinel matrix. The moderator
pins are larger with an external radius of 3.5 mm and a
clad internal radius of 3.2 mm. The target also contains a
europium oxide burnable poison located in a layer of 4
mm thickness situated inside and adjacent to the target
sub-assembly hexagonal wrapper. The main core
parameters for the plutonium sustainability core optimised
for minor actinide recycling are shown in Table VII.

A significant concern with the utilisation of
moderator materials is the possibility for localised power
peaking, leading to excessive fuel and clad temperatures,
either inside the target or in immediately neighbouring
core fuel sub-assemblies. However, a burnable poison can
be used within the target to reduce this power peaking
effect as the large capture cross section at low energy
reduces the number of thermalised neutrons that leak from
the target sub-assembly into the neighbouring core fuel.

However, this is balanced by a low plutonium
consumption rate of 10.1 kg/TWhe due to additional
plutonium production by the minor actinide isotopes. The
minor actinide consumption rate from homogeneous
recycling compares favourably with that obtained from
heterogeneous recycling with either moderated or nonmoderated targets.

VI. FLEXIBILITY
A significant constraint exists in the operation of
liquid metal cooled fast reactors due to the degeneration
of the core safety parameters when poor quality degraded
plutonium fuels are utilised. The worsening of the core
safety parameters is mainly attributed to the coolant void
coefficient as the accumulation of higher plutonium and
minor actinide isotopes causes the coolant void coefficient
to become increasingly more positive.

The remaining core performance parameters for
the homogeneous minor actinide recycling cases are
largely unaffected by the introduction of minor actinides
within the core fuel. The reactivity loss over a cycle is
strongly decreased with the increase in minor actinide
content due to the additional plutonium produced by the
minor actinide isotopes. In all of the cases considered the
control rod reactivity worth is sufficient to cover the
requirements for shutdown allowing for the associated
uncertainties.

The negligible void coefficient in the gas cooled
fast reactor ensures that the consequences of using
degraded plutonium fuels will be less severe. To evaluate
the increased flexibility afforded by the gas cooled fast
reactor three different plutonium qualities have been
utilised in the plutonium consumption and plutonium
sustainability gas cooled core designs, as shown in Table
IX.

As observed previously, there is a significant
reduction in the Doppler constant when minor actinides
are introduced in the core fuel. As the coolant void
coefficient remains small and positive in magnitude the
reduced Doppler constant is still acceptable. On the basis
of these results, a minor actinide content of up to 10% is
possible for the gas cooled fast reactor core design
without any significant implications for the core safety
behaviour.

The results for heterogeneous minor actinide
recycling show that high levels of mass destruction can be
achieved within poisoned moderated targets without
excessive power peaking in the core. A mass destruction
rate of 76% and 72% has been attained for the in-core and
ex-core targets respectively. This corresponds to a peak
burnup of 88.5% and 86.7% heavy atoms. At the same
time there is an associated maximum power peaking
effect within the core fuel sub-assemblies of no more than
5% with either the in-core or ex-core options. The net
minor actinide consumption rate for the in-core and excore moderated targets is 8.5 and 8.8 kg/TWhe , which
compares to a similar value of 8.3 kg/TWhe achieved
with ex-core non-moderated targets. The very high level
of mass destruction in the moderated targets indicates that
the requirement for multi-recycling of the target material
can be avoided in the gas cooled fast reactor.

Case 1 corresponds to plutonium fuel originating
from a once through irradiation of uranium oxide fuel.
Case 2 is the result of twice recycling the Case 1 output in
mixed oxide fuelled reactors. Case 3 corresponds to the
multi-recycling of Case 2 fuel in a gas cooled fast reactor
and is intended to represent the situation after the long
term operation of gas cooled fast reactors whereby an
equilibrium has been achieved with the rest of the reactor
fleet. For each plutonium fuel core performance and
safety parameters have been determined at the start and
end of each equilibrium cycle. A summary of the main
core performance and safety parameters, averaged over all
equilibrium cycles, is given in Table X below.

The performance results obtained for the
different qualities of plutonium composition illustrate the
significant amount of flexibility associated with the gas
cooled fast reactor. No significant modifications to the
core design are required to accommodate a wide range of
plutonium isotopics. A small increase in plutonium
enrichment is necessary with the degradation in the
plutonium quality to compensate for the reduction in the
fissile plutonium content. All of the main performance
parameters follow similar consistent trends and show no
significant deterioration with the change in plutonium
quality. This demonstrates that the gas cooled fast reactor
is capable of safe operation with a wide range of fuels,
and consequently has the flexibility to meet the needs of
the many fuel cycle scenarios that may occur in the future.

Furthermore, high levels of mass destruction, in
excess of 80%, can be attained within poisoned moderated
target sub-assemblies in a single irradiation. An
investigation of the core safety parameters, including the
reactivity effects associated with coolant voiding and
water ingress, has shown that this gas cooled fast reactor
core design is capable of safe operation with a wide range
of plutonium quality fuels. This demonstrates that the gas
cooled fast reactor is capable of satisfying the wide range
of fuel cycle scenarios that may occur in the near and
longer term future.

design technology.

REFERENCES

This gas cooled fast reactor core design has been
evaluated to explore its potential and flexibility for the
effective management of plutonium and minor actinide
stockpiles. It is possible to change from high rates of
plutonium consumption, to moderate plutonium breeding,
or to sustain existing plutonium stocks, with only minor
modifications to the basic reactor design. It is also shown
that the recycling of minor actinides, either
homogeneously or heterogeneously, can be feasibly
undertaken to achieve an equilibrium minor actinide
consumption.
