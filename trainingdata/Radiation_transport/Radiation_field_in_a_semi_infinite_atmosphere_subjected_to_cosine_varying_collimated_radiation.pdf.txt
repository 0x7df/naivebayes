Abstract - Accurate numerical solutions are presented for the radiation field in a semi-infinite, two-dimensional, planeparallel, absorbing-emitting but non-scattering gray atmosphere subjected to cosine-varying collimated incident boundary
radiation. We approximate the kernel of the integral equation for the emissive power by a sum of exponents. After this
approximation the integral equation can be solved exactly. This approach allowed us to find the accurate values for the
source function power and the radiative flux at arbitrary optical depths in the atmosphere.

To compute the radiation field for the problem above one needs the package of FORTRAN-77 double precision codes
EQBETA.FOR .
Key words: 2D radiation transfer, H-function, emissive power, radiative flux

1 INTRODUCTION
There is a group of two-dimensional radiative transfer problems for which an exact solution can be found. These
problems are connected with non-scattering media with the following types of boundary radiation: (1) cosine varying
collimated radiation, (2) strip of collimated radiation, (3) cosine varying diffuse radiation, and (4) constant temperature
strip. In these cases the two -dimensional problem can be reduced to one-dimensional integral equations by the method of
separation of variables. These problems are considered in a series of papers by Breig and Crosbie (Breig, W.F. and
Crosbie, A.L. Two-dimensional radiative equilibrium. J. Math. Anal. Appl., 1974, 46, 104-125.) where also a good
review of literature on the subject is given. Their approach allowed to determine only the external radiation field.
Here we generalize the results of Breig and Crosbie by applying the method of approximating the kernel of the integral
equation for the Sobolev resolvent function (which essentially is the regular part of the respective Green function) by a
series of exponents. The resulting approximate equation has an exact solution which is also represented by a series of
exponents. This allows us to define the auxiliary functions g and h through the resolvent function Φ and thus define all
the relevant functions.
The following is given in detail in: T. Viik, Temperature Distribution in a Semi-Infinite Atmosphere Subjected to Cosine
Varying Collimated Radiation, Proc. Estonian Acad. Sci. Phys. Math., 49 , 2000, pp.40-57.

2 SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF RADIATIVE TRANSFER
We are looking for the emissive power in a homogeneous non-scattering plane-parallel two -dimensional gray
atmosphere which is in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The radiative transfer in such an atmosphere is described by
the following equation

∂τz

where I is the intensity; θ, the polar angle measured from the inward normal to the atmosphere; φ,azimuthal angle
measured from the τx−axis; σ, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant; T, the temperature in the atmosphere; σT 4,the emissive
power. The optical depth τz is measured downward from the boundary of the atmosphere and together with τx and τy
they form a right-hand rectangular co-ordinate system. We require that the energy is transferred only by radiation, i.e.
there is no heat conduction or convection in the atmosphere.

Applying of integrating factor techniques to Eq. (1) we obtain the formal solution for the intensities of downward and

where τy+= τy−τz tanθsin φ, τy′= τy+( τz′ −τz)tanθsin φ, µ = cos θ and I 0+ is the intensity incident on the boundary of the
atmosphere [ 1] .
As far as we require the atmosphere to be in radiative equilibrium we may write

4σT4(τy,τz)=

(4)

where ω is the solid angle.
Substituting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq. (4) we obtain the equation for the emissive power

According to our assumption the incident intensity may be expressed as

I0+(τy+)=I 0[ 1+εexp(i βτy+)] δ( µ−µ0 )δ (φ),

(6)

where I 0 is a constant, ( µ0=cosθ0,φ) defines the direction of the incident collimated radiation, ε is the amplitude of the

cosine wave and δ is the Dirac delta function. Boundary condition (6) means that the top of the atmosphere is illuminated
strip-wise by a parallel beam at an angle θ0 while the strips are parallel to the x - axis and their widths are defined by the
spatial frequency β as π/β in units of optical length τy+. The illumination in the direction parallel to the y - axis varies
according to the cosine law. Next we apply the concept of separation of variables to Eq. (5) by assuming that

σT 4(τy,τz )=

I 0[ B β = 0 (τ,µ 0)+εBβ(τ,µ 0)exp(iβτy)] ,

(7)

where B β is the dimensionless emissive power and τ = τz. Using Eq. (7) in Eq. (5) gives us a simple integral equation for
Bβ in the form

Bβ(τ,µ0)=exp(−τ/µ 0)+ 1

By substituting µ 0 for (t 2+β2) −1/2 in Eq. (8) and multiplying both sides of it by dt/√{t2+β2}, and last, integrating from 1 to
∞ , we arrive at the integral equation for the resolvent function Φβ in the form

∂gβ (τ,µ)

Eqs. (14) and (15) can easily be found from Eqs. (12) and (13) by differentiating them with respect to τ.
Sobolev [

18]

has shown that the solution of Eq. (8) may be written in the form

(16)

or, in our notation,

Bβ( τ,µ 0)=B β(0,µ0)g β ( τ,µ 0)

(17)

Formally this completes the solution of the problem to determine the temperature distribution in a semi-infinite
atmosphere subjected to collimated cosine varying radiation.
Next we show how to find the emissive power at the boundary Bβ(0,µ 0) and the function gβ (τ,µ) at an arbitrary optical
depth.
It is obvious that if β = 0 then Eq. (8) reduces to the equation describing radiation transfer in an one-dimensional medium
which have been successfully solved by introducing the Sobolev's resolvent function [ 2] and then approximating it by a
sum of exponents. Since Eq. (8) is linear and the kernel is a sum of exponents we may try to use the same technique.
First we change the variable u=(t2+β2)− 1/2 in Eq. (9) to reduce this formula to a more familiar form

In Eq. (19) w i and µ i are the weights and points of a Gauss quadrature rule in the interval ( 0,p) and N is the order of the

quadrature [ 3] . The characteristic function Ψ (different from that which appears in the analysis by Breig and Crosbie [ 7]
but nevertheless giving accurate results!) is not a polynomial but it has retained another important quality - it still is an
even function of x.
If we have approximated the general exponential integral as a sum of exponents then Eq. (10) accepts an exact solution as
a sum of exponents [ 13 ]

It is evident that Eq. (22) has exactly N pairs of non-zero solutions ± sk if only β ≠ 0. If β = 0 then s 1=± 0 is also a
solution but as far as this takes us back to the thoroughly studied one -dimensional case, we shall not consider it here.
The roots of the characteristic equation satisfy the following inequalities

0 ≤ | s1| < µN −1 < | s2| < µN −1− 1 < ... < | sN | < µ 1− 1.
As far as the roots are bracketed we may use any of the well-recommended root-finding algorithm, e.g. Brent's method
[ 15] .
In our approximation the functions hβ( τ,µ ) and g β( τ,µ ) (Eqs. (12) and (13)) may be written in the form

It may happen that in certain cases we observe the apparent singularity at siµ = 1 but it can simply be removed by
substituting the respective term in the sum for aiτexp(−τ/µ).

Since the formula for the emissive power at the boundary is given by Sobolev [ 18] in the form

Bβ(0,µ 0)=1+

3 RADIATIVE FLUX
In this section we consider the formulation of the equations for the z−component of radiative flux in the atmosphere and
respective calculations. According to Breig and Crosbie the z −component of radiative flux can be shown to satisfy the
relationship

qz (τy, τ)=I 0Q β = 0 ( τ, µ0)+ εI 0Qβ ( τ,µ 0) exp(i βτy), (28)
where the dimensionless radiative flux is given by

we obtain
