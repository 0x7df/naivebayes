INTRODUCTION
Recent work on obtaining exponential convergence for three-dimensional solutions to the
spatially and angularly continuous monoenergetic transport equation with isotropic scattering
using the reduced source method1,2 was promising.3 The method, however, used two separate
estimates of the scalar flux, a Legendre expansion (in the spatial variables) and a quadrature of
the angular flux. This introduced an inconsistency that may have lead to some convergence
problems. To remove this inconsistency and provide a fairer test of the combined reduced
source/Monte Carlo method, the method was applied to estimate the coefficients of a Legendre
expansion of the solution of the discrete ordinates equations. In this case, no supplementary
approximations were required.

MONTE CARLO SCORING AND SAMPLING
In the present application of the method, the discrete ordinates fluxes ψ m (r) are
expanded in Legendre polynomials as follows:

to the coefficient a m ,ijk (w is the particle’s weight). The angular quadrature weight t m appears in
the denominator because the track length estimator is used to estimate weighted integrals of the
scalar flux rather than the angular flux.
The zero’th stage of the reduced source solution procedure, corresponding to an
approximate solution of Eq. (1), is treated as a “conventional” (non-adaptive) Monte Carlo
problem, except that the particles are constrained to travel along the pre-selected discrete
ordinates. In subsequent (adaptive) stages, particles are started according to the residual sources
Rmn (r ), defined as the right-hand sides of Eqs. (3) and (4), which together describe a system with

a volume source and a source on each surface. The solution to these equations is obtained by
solving the problem for each source independently and adding those solutions.
Rather than sampling from the true (residual) source distribution Rmn (r ), which may be
positive or negative, particles are sampled uniformly in the appropriate phase space (uniformly in
the volume and isotropically in angle for the volume source; uniformly on the surface and
isotropically over the inward-directed half of the angle set for the surface sources). The particle
weight w, which is the ratio of the true density to the sampled density, is V Rmn (r ) for the volume
source and

A Rmn (rs ) for the surface sources. The particle weight can be negative.

As in deterministic discrete ordinates methods, the incoming fluxes must be properly
normalized to preserve the physical source strength. In the present application, this is
accomplished by using a properly normalized value for S m (rs ) in Eq. (4).

RESULTS
The method was tested on a homogeneous three-dimensional slab of dimensions
1 cm × 106 cm × 106 cm and material parameters Σt = 1 and Σs = 0.5. The external source of
Eq. (2) was S m (rs ) = S m (0, y, z ) = µ m , µ m > 0. Figure 1 shows the results of the solution of the
S8 equations using a standard quadrature set, 560 000 particles per stage (except the zero’th, in
which only 80 000 particles were used), and Legendre expansions of order 10 in each direction
with no Legendre product terms in Eq. (5) [e.g., a m,110 P1 ( 2Xx − 1) P1 ( 2Yy − 1) ]. For this simple
problem, Fig. 1 clearly shows exponential convergence of four different residuals and of two
estimates of the known source. The difference between two Monte Carlo scalar fluxes (volume
midpoint and volume average) and those estimated by THREEDANT (Ref. 5) using the same S8
quadrature set are shown for verification. For this problem, convergence was achieved after 10
adaptive stages in 75.1 minutes.

Figure 1. Exponential convergence of an S8 solution in a three-dimensional slab. The
method reproduces the exact incoming flux to about 10–6 (face midpoint) and below 10–7 (face
average). The method reproduces the THREEDANT approximate solution for the scalar flux to
about 10–4 (volume midpoint and volume average). Residuals for these four values converge
exponentially to about 10–8.
